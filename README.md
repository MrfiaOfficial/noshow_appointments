## Conclusions

> The analysis of the dataset "Medical Appoitments No Shows" investiages some factors that influence whether patients will show up for appointments or not. This analysis investigates factors like Gender, AgeGroup, Scholarship, Hypertension, SmsReceived and their relationships with patients showing up for appointment. Analysis shows that factors like Age group, SMS recieved, Hypertension, and Scholarship have significant relationship with patients showing for appoitments. It also shows that factor like Gender has no significant relationship with patients showing up for appointments.

> Analysis to determine the relationship between some factors and showing up for appointment was done using the Pearsonâ€™s Chi-Square Statistical Hypothesis method. It's important to mention that no other statistical method was used for this analysis. 

> For the analysis, the investigation did not consider factors like Handicap, Alcoholism, and Diabetes on how they influence if patients show up for appoitments. 

> In conclusion, there are only four (4) factors that influence if patients will show up for appointments or not out of the five (5) factors investigated. Also, the number of patients that attended medical appointments is greater than the number of patients that didn't show up for medical apppointment.


#### Limitations

- Most of the factors/variables in the dataset are categorical data type (variables).
- The first limitation raised above made it difficult to perform a strong correleation or a quantitative analysis on the dataset, hence such could not be performed.
- Cleaning the data so as to perform adequate analysis made it required to delete some rows with unexpected values, like a negative value for age; hence, not all rows of the data could be worked upon for the analysis.
